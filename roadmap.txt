I plan to make alot of changes and updates to this game.  The current version is a very rough outline of the game 
    (and my first stab at making something myself) and hasnt even been made into a .exe to be shared yet.
My plans include:
    Scaling objects with window
    Adding a "time since you last played" window on opening with score generated while away values
    Moving buy more and buy managers to seperate screens
    Adding bonus items to buy to increase score multipliers
    Adding bonus items to increase speed of tasks
    Adding an acheivements screen to grant some sort of bonus currency
    Changing tasks from the standard idle game left to right bars to something different, what that is I have no idea 
        at this time.
    Updateing the graphics
    Theming the game, currently im thinking its gonna be a cabin builder or something similar.
